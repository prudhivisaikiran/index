    <h1>Courier Prime: A Modern Monospaced Typeface</h1>
    <p><strong>Courier Prime</strong> is a modern version of the classic monospaced typeface Courier, designed specifically for screenplays and creative writing. Here’s a detailed look at the font:</p>

    <h2>Key Features of Courier Prime:</h2>
    <p><strong>Monospaced Design:</strong> Like the original Courier, every character in Courier Prime has the same width, making it a perfect choice for scenarios where alignment is important, such as code editors or manuscripts.</p>
    <p><strong>Optimized for Readability:</strong> Courier Prime is designed to improve readability compared to the original Courier font. It has a cleaner look, with slightly rounded shapes and better letter spacing.</p>

    <h2>Purpose:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Screenplays:</strong> It was created with screenwriters in mind because screenwriting often requires precise formatting, and Courier Prime preserves that traditional look with improved legibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Coding:</strong> It’s also popular in coding environments because the consistent character width is ideal for code alignment and organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Creative Writing:</strong> Writers favor it for its aesthetic simplicity and clarity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Style and Weights:</h2>
    <p>Courier Prime comes in different styles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular</li>
        <li>Bold</li>
        <li>Italic</li>
        <li>Bold Italic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This variety makes it a versatile font choice, allowing for emphasis (like bold or italic text) without changing the font family.</p>

    <h2>Free to Use:</h2>
    <p>Courier Prime is completely free and open-source. It’s available for download on platforms like Google Fonts and Font Squirrel, making it easy to use in any project.</p>

    <h2>Improved Aesthetics:</h2>
    <p>Compared to the traditional Courier, Courier Prime has a more balanced design, with smoother curves and slightly shorter line height, making it feel more modern while maintaining the retro monospaced feel.</p>

    <h2>Use Cases:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Screenwriting:</strong> Since many screenplay formatting software defaults to monospaced fonts, Courier Prime is often the first choice for professional screenwriters.</li>
        <li><strong>Coding:</strong> Developers who prefer monospaced fonts for programming often opt for Courier Prime due to its balanced design.</li>
        <li><strong>Creative Writing:</strong> Writers working on novels or scripts appreciate its legibility and the way it mimics typewritten text, adding a nostalgic feel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pros of Using Courier Prime:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity and legibility:</strong> Ideal for creative writing, coding, and screenplays.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistent width:</strong> Its monospaced nature makes it perfect for any situation that requires aligned text.</li>
        <li><strong>Retro aesthetic:</strong> Appeals to those who enjoy typewriter-like fonts.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional use:</strong> Often used in screenwriting and creative industries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cons:</h2>
    <p><strong>Aesthetic choice:</strong> Its monospaced design may not be ideal for general web or print design, as it's better suited for specific uses like coding or scripts.</p>
